Linear Regression Model
Description
This project demonstrates a linear regression model utilizing 22GB of data from September 2022 to May 2023. The goal is to predict sales using various features and data cleaning techniques.

To use this linear regression model, open and run the Jupyter notebook Linear_Regression_Model.ipynb. The notebook covers the following steps:

1. Data Loading: Load data from September 2022 to May 2023.
2. Merging Datasets: Combine multiple datasets for comprehensive analysis.
3. Data Cleaning: Remove negative sales, filter for specific sales (e.g., Mango), and select relevant columns.
4. Data Preparation: Convert categorical variables to binary, transform datetime to integer, and define features and target variables.
5. Model Training: Fit and train the linear regression model on the prepared data.
6. Performing Predictions: Use the model to predict sales based on the input features.
7. Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using RÂ² score and Mean Squared Error, and visualize the results with scatter plots.
